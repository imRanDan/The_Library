## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, localStorage, and JSON.

Front end made with basic HTML and CSS. the real-magic happens with JavaScript, the use of localStorage and JSON. I created constructors to help group information on the book you can enter in the following text boxes. Creating an add and delete button. I implemented the use of localStorage so when the user leaves the website, they are able to come back and continue where they left off. JSON is used to help store the information.

## Optimizations
A crucial feature I did not have time to add was a modify/edit button. It is not a fully functional CRUD app due to this. I also would have liked to implement a backend with Google Oauth and possibly an existing library api, to help with searching books when you type in the title.

## Lessons Learned:

Working with JavaScript, JSON, and localStorage was a great way to utilize the three to help store information. Grouping and working with the three has helped further my understanding on how they all work together as a team for CRUD apps.
